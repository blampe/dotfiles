# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must
master my life.


## Instructions

You can clone the repo and run `./install.sh`, however recent versions of macOS
require you have XCode Developer Tools be able to even invoke `git`.

For a "cold boot", run the `install.sh` script directly and it will
handle installing Developer Tools in parallel with everything else.

```
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blampe/dotfiles/refactor/install.sh)"
```
