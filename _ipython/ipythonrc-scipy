# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as ipythonrc-scipy,
# it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile scipy' (or '-p scipy')
# option to IPython.

# This example is meant to load several modules to turn ipython into a very
# capable environment for high-end numerical work, similar to IDL or MatLab
# but with the beauty of the Python language.

# load our basic configuration with generic options
include ipythonrc

# import ...
# Load Numpy an SciPy by themselves so that 'help' works on them
import_mod numpy scipy

# from ... import ...
import_some

# Now we load all of SciPy
# from ... import *
import_all numpy
import_all scipy
